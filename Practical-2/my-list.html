                  Tea is the first widely consumed beverage in the world. Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by 
                  pouring boiling water over the leaves of Camellia Sinensis. Different types of tea like Darjeeling and 
                  Chinese greens have a slightly bitter, cooling, and astringent flavor. Tea plants are produced in East 
                  Asia and possibly originated in northern Burma and southwestern China borders. Initially, people consumed 
                  this drink for medicinal purposes. Itâ€™s basically a Camellia Sinensis evergreen plant, which grows mostly 
                  in tropical and subtropical climates.

                  Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an evergreen 
                  shrub of the genus Coffea. The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded 
                  Coffea arabica, and the "robusta" form of the hardier Coffea canephora. Coffee plants are 
                  cultivated in more than 70 countries. Once ripe, coffee "berries" are picked, processed, 
                  and dried to yield the seeds inside.

                  A soft drink is a drink that usually contains carbonated water 
                  (although some vitamin waters and lemonades are not carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural and/or 
                  artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar 
                  substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain 
                  caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other ingredients.

                  Milk is a nutrient-rich liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary 
                  source of nutrition for young mammals, including breastfed human infants before they are able to 
                  digest solid food. Early-lactation milk is called colostrum, which contains antibodies that 
                  strengthen the immune system and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. It holds many other nutrients, 
                  including protein and lactose. Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon, particularly among 
                  humans, many of whom consume the milk of other mammals.

                  Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. 
                  It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, 
                  clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing 
                  amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. 
                  These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing 
                  process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. 
                  In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".
